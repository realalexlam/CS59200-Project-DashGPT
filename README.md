# CS59200-DashGPT
Within this repository, the team was able to create a Video Question and Answer (VQA) was created/designed through the use of the VILA model. This was utilized to provide users personalized responses to specific video clips (of lengths 30-60 seconds) pretaining to the users driving, and methods to possibly improve. 

For the VILA model, the following files were added to run the modified variation for user driving was the following:
- Under the VILA-main\scripts\v1_5\eval\video_chatgpt, a shell script of run_qa_custom.sh was included
- Under the VILA-main\scripts\v1_5\eval\video_chatgpt\GPT_Zero_Shot_QA, a file for CUSTOM_Zero_Shot_QA was included that allowed users to import their own videos, as well as the users specific questions and provide an assumed answer by the user.

In addition to the VILA model for the videos, an application that was able to collect the metrics of a car (speed, acceleration & location). Following this, a front-end UI was created to present the information in an orderly fashion. This front-end UI would show reports, stats, and have a chatroom. Lastly, a VQA was also created/designed in order to provide users personalized responses to images inputted by the user pretaining to the users driving, and methods to possibly improve. All of this could be found in the drop below:
